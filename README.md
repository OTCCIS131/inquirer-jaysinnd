inquirer-jaysinnd


Write a NodeJS application that uses the "chalk" and "inquirer" packages from NPM to take a Pizza Order! Your program should ask the user at least three of the following questions:

What size pizza?
Extra cheese?
What kind of sauce?
Which toppings?
How do you want it cut?
Your program should then repeat the order back to the user, and ask them if it is correct. If not, apologize for the inconvenience and quit the program. If correct, say "It's on it's way!" and quit the program.

Before you begin, plan out your application in a README.md file so that users can know what to expect when they use your program. Your plan might look something like this:

A user executes the program
They are greeted with a friendly message from "My Super Awesome Pizza Co."
They are asked which size pizza they'd like
They are asked which toppings they'd like
They are asked how they'd like it cut
Their order is repeated back to them with pretty colors
The program exits
BE CREATIVE!!! Give your pizza shop a name, a phony phone number, and maybe a logo with ASCII art (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.!
